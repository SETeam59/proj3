| DOI badge: exists | 3 | in README.md |
| Docs: doco generated, format not ugly | 3 | in README |
| Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) | 3 | in README |
| Docs: how: for common use cases X, Y, Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X, Y, Z | 3 | in README |
| Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing | 3 | in README and Advertisement |
| Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code. | 3 | in README |
| Use of version control tools | 3 | Used GitHub for VC |

| Chat channel: exists | 3 | [WhatsApp Group](https://github.com/SETeam59/proj3/blob/master/docs/Team%2059%20WhatsApp%20Group.png) |
| Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases |  | Fixed test cases through pull requests and verified the report using codecov |
| Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files | 3 | All development tools used are free, and the dependency list is available to everyone on GH |
| Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people) | 3 | Installation steps and requirements.txt file ensure that everyone is using the same tools for development |
| Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share the screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer) | 3 | All tools needed for development are listed in the README under the installation section |
| Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base | 3 | All group members worked on multiple features of the application, see commit history |
| Short release cycles | 2 | We followed long term release as the product gets linked with the core system bash files. |
